# Search and Filter

This repository contains a search and filter app built using React and Redux. The app allows users to search for and view a list of items, as well as filter the list by different criteria.

## Getting Started

To use the app, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The app can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The app includes a search bar for users to search for items by keyword.
- The app displays a list of items with their names and descriptions.
- The app allows users to filter the list by category, color, and price range.
- The app updates the list and the filter options based on the search term and selected filters.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the app such as:

- The ability for users to save and load their search and filter settings.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the app, including the color and font.
- The ability to sort the list by different criteria, such as name and price.
